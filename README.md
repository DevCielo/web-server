# Simple Web Server in C (WORK IN PROGRESS)

A minimal web server built from scratch in C to understand low-level network programming, HTTP communication, and systems programming concepts.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a basic web server works by implementing one using the C programming language. It uses direct management of network sockets, memory, and system calls, providing me with a deeper understanding of how the internet works at a low level.

This webserver was built to learn many things including:

- **Network Programming Fundamentals**: Learn how to set up a server using sockets, handle client connections, and manage data transfer.
- **Understanding the HTTP Protocol**: This project covers the basics of the HTTP protocol, including handling requests (like `GET`) and sending appropriate responses.
- **Concurrency and Multi-threading**: Implement a server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously, introducing concepts like multi-threading and concurrency management.
- **Memory Management**: Practice allocating, managing, and freeing memory manually in C, an essential skill for systems programming and performance-critical applications.
- **Error Handling**: Develop robust code by handling various network errors, such as failed connections or malformed requests.
